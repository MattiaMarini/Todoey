The Todoey App is a To Do List App in which I played around with creating random color generation (on the main list new cells are 
assigned a random color), and with gradient colors (on the child list the cells are a gradient of the parent list).

I also added the Realm framework in order to store all the entries created, and the colors assigned at the creation of the entry.

I implemented a dinamic search bar in which for every letter digited the function refreshes the tableview filtering the displayed cells.
